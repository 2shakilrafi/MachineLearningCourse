\begin{enumerate}
    \item While a Hilbert space is a real or complex vector equipped with a norm induced from an inner product under which it is a complete metric space, a reproducing Hilbert space is one in which the evaluation operator $L_x: f \rightarrow f(x)$ is a bounded operator. I honestly can't think of a counterexample, i.e. a Hilbert space that is not reproducing.
